The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?


This is the logic behind the problem

n = "any number"
i = 2
while i*i <= n
    if (n mod i == 0)
        n = n/i
    else
        i = i +1
print n

we start with i = 2 because it is the smallest prime number. We divide n by i(here we initially took i = 2) until it is not divisible by i.
Then we increment i and repeat this process until i * i becomes greater than n. We stop here as any number when divided by a number greater than its root, 
the result is a number less than the root of the original number.

For example take 100, the factorisations of 100:
1 x 100
2 x 50
4 x 25
5 x 20
10 x 10
20 x 5
25 x 4
50 x 2
100 x 1

Basically, if a number has a factor larger than root n, the matching factor smaller than root n will be found first. 

This is the python solution I got to the above problem 

n = 600851475143
i = 2
while i * i <= n:
    if n % i == 0:
        n //= i
    else:
        i += 1
print(n)
