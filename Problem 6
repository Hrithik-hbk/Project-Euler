The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
                        1^2 + 2^2 + ....... + 10^2 = 385.
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
                        (1+ 2+ ...... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence, the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.



Sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula  n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Sum of squares of the first 100 natural numbers = 100 * 101 * 201 / 6 = 338350

Sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula   n(n+1)/2

Sum of the first 100 natural numbers = 100 * 101 /2 = 5050

Square of the sum of the first 100 natural numbers = (5050)^2 = 25502500

Difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum = 25502500 - 338350 = 25164150

SO, the answer to the problem is 25164150.
