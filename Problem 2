Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,.....
By considering the terms in the Fibonnaci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



This question can be difficult to solve with a pen and paper. So I implemented this in Python.

This is the algorithmic logic behind the question:
limit = 4000000
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
while c < limit
    sum = sum + c
    a = b
    b = c


This is the Python code with which I implemented:

limit = 4000000
a = 1
b = 2
f = [a,b]
sum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    c = a + b
    if c > limit:
        break
    f.append(c)
    a = b
    b = c

for i in range(len(f)):
    if f[i]%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + f[i]

print (sum)
